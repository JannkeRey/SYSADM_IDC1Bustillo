**Part 2. Network Scalability Analysis**

Recall the e-commerce website scenario we discussed earlier. Given the
expected surge in traffic, analyze the provided network topology
diagram. Identify potential bottlenecks and areas where scalability
might be a concern. Propose specific strategies to improve the
network\'s scalability and performance to ensure a seamless user
experience during the peak traffic period. Consider factors such as
increased user demand, new applications, and security threats.

![](vertopal_92cf16098c9741678a97ed36306a7ef0/media/image3.webp){width="5.049483814523184in"
height="3.8229166666666665in"}

**Analysis of the Current Network Topology**

The current topology is relatively simple, with a single core switch
connecting VLANs via Layer 2 switches. While functional, this setup has
potential bottlenecks and scalability concerns:

1.  Core Switch as a Single Point of Failure

-   If the core switch fails, the entire network collapses.

2.  Layer 2 Switch Bottlenecks

-   VLAN traffic relies heavily on the uplink to the core switch. High
    traffic during peak hours (12 PM--3 PM) can overload uplinks.

3.  Insufficient Redundancy

-   No backup for the core switch, edge router, or ISP, leading to a
    lack of fault tolerance.

4.  Limited Scalability

-   Adding more servers or applications could overwhelm existing
    switches and bandwidth.

5.  Potential Security Vulnerabilities

-   No clear indication of dedicated firewalls, intrusion
    detection/prevention systems, or DDoS protection.

**Proposed Strategies to Improve Scalability and Performance**

height="4.632638888888889in"}

I.  Add a Backup Core Switch

-   Introduce a secondary core switch configured in Active-Passive mode
    using protocols like VRRP or HSRP to ensure network redundancy and
    eliminate the core switch as a single point of failure. This setup
    ensures seamless failover if the primary core switch fails,
    maintaining network uptime during critical periods.

II. Upgrade to Layer 3 Distribution Switches

-   Replace the existing Layer 2 switches with Layer 3 switches to
    handle inter-VLAN routing more efficiently. By offloading routing
    tasks from the core switch and implementing EtherChannel for
    increased uplink bandwidth, this upgrade reduces bottlenecks and
    improves scalability.

III. Introduce Redundant ISPs

-   Add a backup ISP and configure the edge router for load balancing or
    failover to ensure uninterrupted internet connectivity during peak
    traffic periods or ISP outages, enhancing overall network
    availability.

IV. Increase Uplink Bandwidth

-   Utilize EtherChannel to combine multiple physical links into a
    single logical connection, effectively increasing the bandwidth
    between switches and alleviating potential congestion during
    high-traffic events.

V.  Deploy Load Balancers

-   Implement hardware or load balancers to evenly distribute traffic
    across servers, preventing server overload and improving response
    times and user experience during peak periods.

VI. Add a Firewall and IDS/IPS

-   Deploy a robust firewall solution such as Adguard to block external
    threats and integrate an IDS/IPS like Snort for real-time monitoring
    and prevention of attacks, safeguarding the network from malicious
    actors during high-profile campaigns.

VII. Optimize Server Resources

-   Scale server resources by increasing CPU cores and RAM (vertical
    scaling) or adding more servers (horizontal scaling) to ensure
    sufficient capacity for handling the anticipated fivefold increase
    in traffic during peak hours.

VIII. Bandwidth Management

-   If the number of connected devices increases, will the links between
    layers (core to distribution, distribution to access) have enough
    bandwidth to avoid congestion. If the current uplinks are 1 Gbps,
    will they support future needs? If not, consider upgrading to 10
    Gbps links or higher.
